# Full-stack JavaScript Engineer (f|m|d)

Build the platform that empowers thousands of creators.

## The Position

JavaScript is the programming language of choice for building products for the internet. The language and ecosystem are so powerful and give the great opportunity to apply a full-stack approach across the system, from APIs to front-end applications, as well as infrastructure and more.

The position is the right fit for you if you are passionate and excited about the latest developments in that ecosystem, just as we are.

You'll help us improve our entire platform, from our single-page web apps to our Node.js backend services.

You are always keen to challenge the current way doing things and try to improve it by making technical decisions and introducing best practices.

You'll be working in a small team that operates agilely and without overhead.

Your daily routine includes discussions with your peers to help find the best solutions and a default to action.

## About you

- You have experience and love working with JavaScript. Ideally, you've worked with technologies like Node.js, React.js, Hapi.js, or Express.js.
- You love writing well-tested and robust code, according to modern JavaScript best practices and standards.
- You care equally about _how_ software is build as about having it done.
- You strive for innovative solutions that push the company and your peers instead of accepting the status quo.
- You leave no stone unturned when you hunt for solutions. New problems occur every single day and sometimes we need to leave our comfort zone to tackle them.
- You're passionate about sharing your knowledge and experience among the team.

## A few of the things you might work on

**React.js single-page applications**: The most important part for our customers. We write all our SPAs in React.js, Redux, and the ecosystem around both. You might help us integrate a new feature by creating isolated, reusable, and well-tested React components.

**Node.js micro-service APIs**: The APIs are the foundation of everything. We put a lot of effort into the quality, robustness, and scalability of our APIs. Designing new interfaces, creating new endpoints and improving the testability are integral parts.

**CI / CD system**: The bread and butter of successful product development. We ship software every day, and we want to make sure it's done with high quality, looking out for test coverage and always keeping the build green. We apply automated test execution and code quality checks, like ESLint.

**Product management**: You can only do an excellent job if you know why we build things from a product perspective. That is why you work with the product team to define and test features.

## About us

**Full-stack approach**: The engineering team has a full-stack approach. We encourage every engineer to work on the full range of tasks (infrastructure, backend, frontend) based on their preference. The team members support each other to have the knowledge and skills for it.

**Our engineering blog**: We publish articles about our learnings and initiatives. You might find something interesting, and we'd love for you to share your experiences and findings too. [You should check it out](https://eqolot.com/technologie/blog/).

**Remote work**: We are open to people who don't live in Berlin and don't want to relocate. The only requirement at the moment is that you live in Europe. This makes the organization and process easier for all of us.
