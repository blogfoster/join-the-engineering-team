# JavaScript Engineer (f|m|d)

Build the platform that empowers thousands of bloggers and influencers.

## The Position

JavaScript is the programming language of our choice to build products for the internet. The language and ecosystem are so powerful and gives a great opportunity to apply the full-stack approach across the system, like APIs, front-end applications, infrastructure, and more.

The position is the right fit if you are passionate and excited about the latest developments in that ecosystem, just as we are.

You'll help us improve our entire platform, from our single-page web apps to our Node.js backend services.

You are always keen to challenge the current way of how to do things and try to improve it by making technical decisions and introducing standards.

You'll be working in a small team that operates agile and without much overhead.

Your daily routine includes discussions with your peers to help find the best solutions and a default to action.

## About you

- Do you have gained entry-level software development experience with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS?
- Do you want to develop and extend your skills in working with JavaScript and ecosystem?
- Are you a curious learner and practitioner who is willing to learn new techniques and technologies?
- Youâ€™re passionate about having technical conversations and sharing your experience among the team.

## A few of the things you might work on

**React.js single-page applications**: The most important part for our customers. We write all our SPAs in React.js, Redux, and the ecosystem around both. You might help us integrate a new feature by creating isolated, reusable, and well-tested React components.

**Node.js micro-service APIs**: The APIs are the foundation of everything. We put a lot of effort into the quality, robustness, and scalability of our APIs. Designing new interfaces, creating new endpoints and improving the testability is an integral part.

**CI / CD system**: The bread and butter of successful product development. We ship software every day, and we want to make sure it happens with high quality, looking out for test coverage and for always keeping the build green. We apply automated test execution and code quality checks, like ESLint.

**With product management**: You can only do an excellent job if you know why we build things from a product perspective. That is why you work with the product management to test features.

## About us

**Mentoring:** The team continuously supports you to develop and grow your skills as a professional software engineer.

**Impact:** Your work has a direct impact on our tens of thousands of influencers and hundreds of brands.

**Involvement:** Participate in all phases of the development; from requirements to deployment.

**Agile development methodology:** We use Kanban as our preferred way to coordinate our tasks. It gives us the focus and flexibility to handle software projects in the right balance.

**Learning:** We support you with paid learning materials, like online courses, etc. to learn new techniques and technologies.
