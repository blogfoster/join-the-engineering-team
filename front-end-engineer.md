## What technology do we use?

Our complete web stack is build on top of JavaScript. Our single-page web apps are powered by React and ecosystem. Even so React is still young, we are totally convinced that it boosts our results and progress.We use Sass to develop solid and maintainable CSS. Combined with Webpack it finds its way into encapsulated components.

All our applications are fueled with data by our Node.js services on the backend. Beside the specific technologies, we regularly reevaluate our decisions to make sure that we always enable the further growth and success of the company.
