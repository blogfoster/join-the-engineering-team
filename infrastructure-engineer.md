# Infrastructure Engineer (f/m)

Run and scale the platform that empowers thousands of bloggers and influencers.

## The position

We are looking for a DevOps engineer to strengthen our development team. Your work directly impacts thousands of influencers and hundreds of brands that use our platform.

The foundation for this position is a good understanding of writing code. 

Your focus will be on our platform’s microservice architecture and infrastructure; building a solid foundation to enable further growth and a stable platform.

You’ll be working in a small team that tries to operate agile and without much overhead.

Your daily routine includes discussions with your peers to help find the best solutions and a default to action.

## About You

- Do you have experience running scalable infrastructure on AWS?
- Do you love designing, building and operating modern cloud infrastructure?
- Are you comfortable writing code to automate infrastructure?
- Do you strive for creative solutions that push the company and your peers instead of accepting the status quo?
- Experience running Node.js services and Docker in production is a big plus though not a requirement.
- You're passionate about sharing your knowledge and experience among the team.

## A few of the things you might work on

**Cloud infrastructure**: One integral part of our system are its resources. We host our infrastructure on Amazon Web Services and Compose.io. Help us manage the setup effectively using infrastructure as code.

**Platform reliability**: One of the most critical parts of our business is the uptime of our platform. No customer will be happy if it’s either slow or down. You will work on approaches to regularly review our infrastructure and take actions accordingly.

**CI / CD system**: The bread and butter of successful product development. We ship software every day, and we want to make sure it happens with high quality. You work with us on improving our development and deployment pipelines for a faster feedback and shipping cycle, and to detect and understand problems early.

**Developer tooling**: You can help us built the tools that enable engineers to understand the impact of their changes in production. You'll collaborate with our engineers to help them ship better code.

## About us

**Full-stack approach**: The engineering team applies a full-stack approach. We encourage every engineer to work on the full range of tasks (infrastructure, backend, frontend) based on their preferences. The team supports each other to have the knowledge and skills for it.

**Our engineering blog**: We regularly publish articles about React & Co., Node.js, product development and engineering management. You might find something interesting, and we'd love for you to share your experiences and findings too. You should check it out.

**10% time**: Everybody on the team is free to spend 10% of their work time on innovative ideas and technologies which interest them, such as open source and thought leadership.

**Remote work**: We are open to people who don’t live in Berlin and don’t want to relocate. The only requirement at the moment is that you live in Europe. This makes the organization and process easier for all of us.
