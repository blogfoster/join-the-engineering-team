# About blogfoster

blogfoster is a berlin-based tech company that allows social media influencers to analyze, manage and monetise their market reach. We put bloggers and influencers in touch with businesses to create data-driven content performance marketing campaigns. Thousands of bloggers and over 350 advertisers are already using our market-leading technology.

It is crucial for both advertisers and influencers to have access to accurate data, measurements and transparency. That’s why blogfoster has developed its own tracking solution: blogfoster Insights. This is a tracking tool that every blogfoster blogger must integrate into their website in order to provide valuable data to both themselves and to advertisers for campaign optimisation. Moreover, blogfoster handles the entire process from start to finish – from the initial selection of influencers and basic conceptualisation of marketing campaigns right through to invoicing and payment.

What has started with bloggers is now moving towards all kinds of social media influencers and we plan to combine all as one in a solution that brings advertising value to every social media user in the world.
